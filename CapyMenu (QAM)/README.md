**CapyMenu for QAM** is a tool offering a variety of options as well as pre-configured colors to customize the appearence of the Quick Access Menu (QAM) (triggered by pressing the three dots button). This includes the possibility to set your own colors and gradients for backgrounds, buttons, sliders (via SuchMeme's [Colored Toggles](https://deckthemes.com/themes/view?themeId=d08de13f-2ef5-4d83-8b41-bbb325b3c5e1), among other features. While I didn't want to clutter the options too much in order to keep this tweak as user-friendly as possible, it still offers a good amount of configuration possibilities, so you might want to make good use of CSS Loader presets feature. Also, SuchMeme & Emerson-Biggons' [Pip-Boy](https://deckthemes.com/themes/view?themeId=54cda487-9697-4eaa-94dc-1a613becdc8d) and GrodanBool's [Outrun](https://deckthemes.com/themes/view?themeId=4ba8fe8b-fbd9-457c-94fc-f3555a8877bf) themes helped a lot in figuring out some parts of the styling process, in combination with CEF Debugger. The Notifications and Friends sections have been tweaked almost thoroughly but they still lack additional consistency due to tedious and inconvenient testing process. This theme is complementary to my other [CapyMenu CSS tweak](https://github.com/Kalyvara/CSS-Loader-releases/tree/main/CapyMenu%20(Steam)).

Please note that this theme conflicts with EMERALD's [Obsidian](https://deckthemes.com/themes/view?themeId=f16cf40d-7ccc-4981-95bf-77b28e8d101e) (just some minor UI glitches in the QAM, other UI sections shouldn't be affected), *unless* you set your main background color to OLED black at full opacity.
